[00:07.64] Goodbye Norma Jeane
[00:10.48] Though I never knew you at all
[00:13.36] You had the grace to hold yourself
[00:16.10] While those around you crawled
[00:21.82] They crawled out of the woodwork
[00:25.78] And they whispered into your brain
[00:28.93] They set you on the treadmill
[00:31.99] And they made you change your name
[00:48.99] 
[00:37.55] And it seems to me you lived your life
[00:41.74] Like a candle in the wind
[00:45.38] Never knowing who to cling to
[00:49.17] When the rain set in
[00:52.65] And I would've liked to known you
[00:56.26] But I was just a kid
[00:59.36] Your candle burned out long before
[01:03.15] Your legend ever did
[01:13.15] 
[01:18.97] Loneliness was tough
[01:21.53] The toughest role you ever played
[01:24.10] Hollywood created a superstar
[01:28.33] And pain was the price you paid
[01:33.45] Even when you died
[01:37.45] Oh the press still hounded you
[01:40.39] All the papers had to say
[01:43.44] Was that Marilyn was found in the nude
[02:02.44] 
[01:49.43] And it seems to me you lived your life
[01:53.15] Like a candle in the wind
[01:56.80] Never knowing who to cling to
[02:00.58] When the rain set in
[02:04.47] And I would've liked to known you
[02:07.82] But I was just a kid
[02:10.83] Your candle burned out long before
[02:14.53] Your legend ever did
[02:24.53] 
[02:30.32] Goodbye Norma Jeane
[02:33.09] Though I never knew you at all
[02:36.11] You had the grace to hold yourself
[02:39.63] While those around you crawled
[02:54.63] 
[02:45.58] Goodbye Norma Jeane
[02:47.86] From the young man in the twenty second row
[02:51.83] Who sees you as something as more than sexual
[02:55.03] More than just our Marilyn Monroe
[03:11.53] 
[03:00.79] And it seems to me you lived your life
[03:04.49] Like a candle in the wind
[03:08.30] Never knowing who to cling to
[03:11.83] When the rain set in
[03:15.56] And I would've liked to known you
[03:19.17] But I was just a kid
[03:22.09] Your candle burned out long before
[03:25.93] Your legend ever did
[03:35.93] 
[03:31.58] Your candle burned out long before
[03:35.48] Your legend ever did
